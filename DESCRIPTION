Description: 
  The metaGLMM package extends traditional random-effects meta-analysis by embedding it within a generalized linear mixed-effects model framework, thereby enabling covariate adjustment and support for non-normal responses. 
  The package provides likelihood-based inference using only aggregate data and includes computationally efficient implementations for likelihood evaluation.
  The underlying methodology is based on Hanada (2025).
