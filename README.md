The metaGLMM package extends traditional random-effects meta-analysis by embedding it within a generalized linear mixed-effects model framework, thereby enabling covariate adjustment and support for non-normal responses. This methodology was introduced in Hanada (2025); please be sure to cite that paper when using this package.
